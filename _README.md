1. Define every HTML page that is required for the site
2. Create a HTML template that includes a link to the main CSS file, JS file, to datatables CSS and JS.
3. Ensure that this template has the correct responsive layout.
NOTE - Are we using Bootstrap? Should we create a sidebar, header, main and footer sections in Bootstrap?
4. Publish the site at Github Pages
5. Create all of the basic pages and link them together.
6. Assign work to each team member to complete multiple pages
7. One team member works on creating the CSS stylesheet and sidebar. The completed sidebar should be supplied to each team member
8. One team member should work on getting datatables working
9. One team member should be responsible for ensuring consistent work throughout the project. For example, make sure that each team member is using the correct css classes and bootstrap for layout.
